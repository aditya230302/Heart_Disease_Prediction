# Heart_Disease_Prediction

## Problem Statement:
- You are the data scientist at a medical research facility. The facility wants you to build a machine learning model to classify if the given data of a patient should tell if the patient is at the risk of a heart attack.

## Heart Disease Dataset:
- UCI Heart Disease Dataset
- (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease?spm=5176.100239.blogcont54260.8.TRNGoO)
- DATA SET INFORMATION
  - age
  - sex
  - cp : chest pain type (4 values)
  - trestbps : resting blood pressure (on admission to the hospital)
  - chol : serum cholestoral
  - fbs : fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
  - restecg : resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
  - thalach : maximum heart rate achieved
  - exang : exercise induced angina
  - oldpeak : ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
  - slope : the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
  - ca : number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
  - thal : 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect
  - target : diagnosis of heart diseaseck.

## Lab Environment:
- Jupyter Notebooks

## Domain:
- Healthcare
